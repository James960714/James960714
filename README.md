### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning software development at Northcoders on their Softare Engineering bootcamp. 

New to the world of coding and software development. I have completed free online courses and recently come to the end of the Northcoders Software Engineering bootcamp (Mar - Jun 2024). I have learn't some of the basics in C, but predominantly have experience in Javascript following the bootcamp.

Looking forward to learning more ðŸ˜€
