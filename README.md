### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I have recently graduated from the software development at Northcoders. 

New to the world of coding and software development. I have completed free online courses and recently come to the end of the Northcoders Software Engineering bootcamp (Mar - Jun 2024). I have learn't some of the basics in C, but predominantly have experience in Javascript following the bootcamp. The course taught me in both back-end and front-end practices, culminating in a solo project (NC News) which can be found on my profile and final group project (Day-Planner), also on my profile.  

Looking forward to learning more ðŸ˜€
